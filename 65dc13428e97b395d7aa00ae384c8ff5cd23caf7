# <img align="center" height="70" src="./Docs/Images/AppIcon.png"/> GitHub Copilot for Xcode

[GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) is an AI pair programmer
tool that helps you write code faster and smarter. Copilot for Xcode is an Xcode extension that provides inline coding suggestions as you type and a chat assistant to answer your coding questions.

## Chat

GitHub Copilot Chat provides suggestions to your specific coding tasks via chat.

## Agent Mode

GitHub Copilot Agent Mode provides AI-powered assistance that can understand and modify your codebase directly. With Agent Mode, you can:
- Get intelligent code edits applied directly to your files
- Run terminal commands and view their output without leaving the interface
- Search through your codebase to find relevant files and code snippets
- Create new files and directories as needed for your project
- Get assistance with enhanced context awareness across multiple files and folders
- Run Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools you configured to extend the capabilities

Agent Mode integrates with Xcode's environment, creating a seamless development experience where Copilot can help implement features, fix bugs, and refactor code with comprehensive understanding of your project.

## Code Completion

You can receive auto-complete type suggestions from GitHub Copilot either by starting to write the code you want to use, or by writing a natural language comment describing what you want the code to do.

## Requirements

- macOS 12+
- Xcode 8+
- A GitHub Copilot subscription. To learn more, visit [https://github.com/features/copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot).

## Getting Started

1. Install via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

   ```sh
   brew install --cask github-copilot-for-xcode
   ```

   Or download the `dmg` from
   [the latest release](https://github.com/github/CopilotForXcode/releases/latest/download/GitHubCopilotForXcode.dmg).
   Drag `GitHub Copilot for Xcode` into the `Applications` folder:

   <p align="center">
     <img alt="Screenshot of opened dmg" src="./Docs/Images/dmg-open.png" width="512" />
   </p>

   Updates can be downloaded and installed by the app.

1. Open the `GitHub Copilot for Xcode` application (from the `Applications` folder). Accept the security warning.
   <p align="center">
     <img alt="Screenshot of MacOS download permission request" src="./Docs/Images/macos-download-open-confirm.png" width="350" />
   </p>


1. A background item will be added to enable the GitHub Copilot for Xcode extension app to connect to the host app. This permission is usually automatically added when first launching the app.
   <p align="center">
     <img alt="Screenshot of background item" src="./Docs/Images/background-item.png" width="370" />
   </p>

1. Three permissions are required for GitHub Copilot for Xcode to function properly: `Background`, `Accessibility`, and `Xcode Source Editor Extension`. For more details on why these permissions are required see [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](./TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

   The first time the application is run the `Accessibility` permission should be requested:

   <p align="center">
     <img alt="Screenshot of accessibility permission request" src="./Docs/Images/accessibility-permission-request.png" width="529" />
   </p>

   The `Xcode Source Editor Extension` permission needs to be enabled manually. Click
   `Extension Permission` from the `GitHub Copilot for Xcode` application settings to open the
   System Preferences to the `Extensions` panel. Select `Xcode Source Editor`
   and enable `GitHub Copilot`:

   <p align="center">
     <img alt="Screenshot of extension permission" src="./Docs/Images/extension-permission.png" width="582" />
   </p>

1. After granting the extension permission, open Xcode. Verify that the
   `Github Copilot` menu is available and enabled under the Xcode `Editor`
   menu.
    <br>
    <p align="center">
      <img alt="Screenshot of Xcode Editor GitHub Copilot menu item" src="./Docs/Images/xcode-menu.png" width="648" />
    </p>

    Keyboard shortcuts can be set for all menu items in the `Key Bindings`
    section of Xcode preferences.

1. To sign into GitHub Copilot, click the `Sign in` button in the settings application. This will open a browser window and copy a code to the clipboard. Paste the code into the GitHub login page and authorize the application.
    <p align="center">
      <img alt="Screenshot of sign-in popup" src="./Docs/Images/device-code.png" width="372" />
    </p>

1. To install updates, click `Check for Updates` from the menu item or in the
   settings application.

   After installing a new version, Xcode must be restarted to use the new
   version correctly.

   New versions can also be installed from `dmg` files downloaded from the
   releases page. When installing a new version via `dmg`, the application must
   be run manually the first time to accept the downloaded from the internet
   warning.

1. To avoid confusion, we recommend disabling `Predictive code completion` under
   `Xcode` > `Preferences` > `Text Editing` > `Editing`.

1. Press `tab` to accept the first line of a suggestion, hold `option` to view
   the full suggestion, and press `option` + `tab` to accept the full suggestion.

   Open Copilot Chat in GitHub Copilot.
  - Open via the Xcode menu `Xcode -> Editor -> GitHub Copilot -> Open Chat`.
